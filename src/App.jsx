/*
Here are the instructions for todayâ€™s workshop.
- Create a React app that retrieves and displays a list of pokemon
- When you click on a pokemon in the list, it should go to a details page displaying more - information about it (probably want a back button as well)
- Add a form that allows the user to create their own pokemon
